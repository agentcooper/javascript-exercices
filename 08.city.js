// Task: simulate hunger in the city.

// We have a city. Inside the city there are humans and shops.

// Shops recieve new food periodically, in some random intervals.

// People become hungry.

// When a person is hungry he goes to the available shops in the city and tries to find the food.

// If the person can find the food, his hunger decreases.

// If person is without food for long enough, he dies.

// Write a code which will start a simulation of this process. Program should print what is happening inside the city.
